>> Before Running FEAT

Before calling the FEAT GUI, you need to prepare each session's data as a 4D NIFTI or Analyze format image; there are utilities in fsl/bin called fslmerge and fslsplit to convert between multiple 3D images and a single 4D (3D+time) image.

>> FEAT Basics

You can setup FEAT to process many input images, one after another, as long as they all require exactly the same analysis.

First-level or Higher-level Analysis?
Use First-level analysis for analysing each session's data - i.e. the time-series analysis of the raw 4D FMRI data.
Use Higher-level analysis for combining first-level analyses. You can use this hierarchically - for example at second-level to analyse across several sessions and then at third-level to analyse across several subjects.
