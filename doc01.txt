This directory contains the following images:

A structural scan: STRUCT.nii.gz
A functional scan: FUNC.nii.gz
A magnitude fieldmap image: FMAP_MAG.nii.gz
A phase fieldmap image: FMAP_PHASE.nii.gz
A text file containing the fieldmap information: FMAPS.txt
A folder containing an example registration (EXAMPLE_REG - we will use this a bit later)
A folder containing data for the optional section (multiband_data)
